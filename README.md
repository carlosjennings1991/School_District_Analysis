# School District Analysis
This analysis reviews the differences and trends within schools, primarily looking how different grades, school sizes, and school types perform. The screenshot below shows a school level summary of most of the data of our concern.

What we want to know for the purpose of this study is the following:

* How does the school type affect outcome? (Charter vs District)
* How does school size affect outcome?
* How does funding per pupil affect outcome?
* How does each individual grade perform?

A secondary goal was to correct for tainted data, the reading & math scores for ninth graders in Thomas High School, which had to be corrected for.
